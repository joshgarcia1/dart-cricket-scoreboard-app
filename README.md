# Dart Cricket Scoreboard Mobile Application

An interactive, multi-player game tracking application designed for tracking, resuming, and managing game states with an intuitive interface. Built with React Native and Expo Router, the app provides a seamless user experience across platforms.

## Features

## Technology Stack

- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile app development.
- **Expo Router**: Advanced routing and navigation.
- **AsyncStorage**: Local storage for game state persistence.

## Architecture

The application uses a modular architecture to separate concerns:
- **Screens**: Individual pages like `Game Screen`, `Game History`, and `Winner Popup`.
- **State Management**: Local state is managed within React components and persisted using `AsyncStorage`.
- **Database**: Tracks in-progress and completed games, players, and move history with constraints to ensure data integrity.
