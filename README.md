# Dart Cricket Scoreboard Mobile Application

## Background
The Dart Cricket Scoreboard Mobile Application was created to address a common challenge among dart players: efficiently tracking scores during competitive games. Traditional scorekeeping methods, such as chalkboards or paper, often result in errors, confusion, or gameplay delays. This app offers a digital solution that enhances the experience for casual players and tournament participants. It bridges the gap between traditional play and modern convenience by incorporating intuitive controls, real-time updates, and game history management.

The development of this project was driven by the need for an easy-to-use, mobile-friendly scoreboard application tailored to the game darts cricket. The goal was to provide a tool accessible to a broad audience while adhering to industry best practices in mobile app development. The app leverages modern frameworks like React Native and Expo to ensure high app speed, reliability, and performance.

## Features

- **In-Progress Game Tracking**: Save and resume games with all game states intact.

## Architecture

The application uses a modular architecture to separate concerns:
- **Screens**: Individual pages like `Home Page`, `Game Screen`, `Game Setup`, `Game History`, `About`, and `Winner Popup`.
- **State Management**: Local state is managed within React components and persisted using `AsyncStorage`.
- **Database**: Tracks in-progress and completed games, players, and move history with constraints to ensure data integrity.
